# anktui

This is a tui application for the Anki method of studying with flashcards and spaced repetition.

I'm building this project for myself. Hopefully some others will find it useful as well.

---

# Current Features

- CRUD functions for flashcard decks and cards
- Study with Anki method (spaced repetition, card difficulty rating, etc)
- Practice mode for going through whole decks

---

# Current TODO

- Enable statistics
- Create themes
- Add deck/card importing and exporting (compatible with Anki desktop application)
- Enable sharing of decks between users
- Refine UI/UX (will take time and possibly feedback)
- Generate releases on Github
- Make available on package managers under `anktui`
- Better management of deck/card data. Current stored in base repo under `anktui/data/`

---

# Build

`go build -o anktui` <- name the binary as you like but `anktui` is the official name.

# Feedback or Contributions

Please feel free to provide feedback whether it be on Github in issues or on Twitter(X).
This is very much a work in progress and subject to change in any form or fashion.
In the project's current state I would classify it as an MVP. Bare functionality is there but a lot more to be done.

Study hard!
